# NinjaPhenix's Container Library
In short this contains all the code from Expanded Storage used to open inventories including the different screen options.

If you are to consume this library please jar in jar it or have users download it from Curseforge or Modrinth *when released*.

Whilst you may fork and shade this project and add your own features I would prefer to avoid multiple versions of the library as it would worsen the user experience.

Therefore, if anything can be added to help please let me know or feel free to open a PR.

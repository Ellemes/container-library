- Introduce V3 api which is marked as experimental, I would like input from api consumers to see if anything needs adjusting.
  - Eventually I want to allow opening up the networking to allow for mods to introduce their own screen opening mechanism.
- Allow inventories to be opened by spectators. (Minor breaking change but seems like no downstream projects will be affected.)
- Add quark support on forge.
